## Slide 1: Title
**Snowflake Cortex Analyst**  
*LLM-powered, fully-managed text-to-SQL solution for conversational analytics*  

---

## Slide 2: Overview
- **What is it?**  
  - A fully-managed, large language model (LLM)-powered feature in Snowflake Cortex  
  - Lets business users ask questions in **natural language** and get direct answers without writing SQL  
- **Why it Matters**  
  - Rapidly deliver high-precision, self-service analytics  
  - Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) with Snowflake’s scalable engine  

---

## Slide 3: Key Features
- **Text-to-SQL via LLMs**  
  - Interprets business questions and generates SQL queries on the fly  
- **Semantic Model**  
  - Rich YAML-based model for higher accuracy (maps business concepts to database schemas)  
- **Convenient REST API**  
  - Easily integrate into Slack, Teams, Streamlit apps, or any custom interface  
- **Security and Governance**  
  - Respects Snowflake’s RBAC and governance policies  
  - Data stays within Snowflake’s boundary unless you opt-in to Azure OpenAI models

## Slide 4: Setup & Access
1. **Enable Cortex Analyst**:  
   - `ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENABLE_CORTEX_ANALYST = TRUE;`  
2. **Grant Access**:  
   - Must have `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER` role or equivalent  
   - Control semantic model visibility via stages and SELECT privileges  
3. **Semantic Model YAML**:  
   - Upload to a Snowflake stage or pass inline  
   - Grants natural language knowledge of tables, columns, metrics  

---

## Slide 5: Limitations & Region Availability
- **Limitations**  
  - Default rate limit: 20 requests/min  
  - Cannot access results of previous queries in multi-turn conversation  
  - Strictly for SQL-resolvable questions; no broad “insights” generation  
- **Regions**  
  - Natively available in select AWS & Azure regions (Virginia, Oregon, Frankfurt, etc.)  
  - Cross-region inference can be enabled for accounts outside these regions  

---

## Slide 6: Cost & Next Steps
- **Usage Cost**:  
  - Based on messages processed (successful requests)  
  - Warehouse costs still apply for any executed SQL queries  
- **Next Steps**  
  - Set up a semantic model and stage  
  - Integrate via REST API or Streamlit for a user-friendly chat interface  
  - Consider enabling Azure OpenAI models if needed for advanced LLM options

**Q&A** (Optional Slide)
- Any questions on setup, security, or usage?

### Tips
- Keep slides clean with **short bullet points**.  
- Add a simple **flow diagram** showing “User → Natural Language → Cortex Analyst → SQL → Snowflake Data → Answer.”  

Use these slides as a foundation, and feel free to add visuals or additional details based on your audience’s needs.
