1. Data Pull Module
Checksum validation (data/file integrity).
Verification of the number of records extracted against the expected count.
Data integrity check during extraction (e.g., validation of required fields).
2. Polling Module
File size comparison before and after transfer.
Line count validation between the original file and the file in the stage.
Integrity check of file names and directory structures.
3. StgLoad Module
Data type validation before loading into target tables.
Primary key uniqueness verification to prevent duplicates.
Consistency check of file formats and delimiters before loading.
4. Transformation Module
Referential integrity checks between primary and foreign keys.
Aggregate validation (totals, sums) to ensure they match the original data.
Completeness verification of transformations (ensuring all data was transformed correctly).
5. Data Downstream Module
Consistency check between upstream and downstream data.
Validation of the format and structure of files generated for downstream consumption.
Verification of the exact match between transformed data and the data sent to other systems.
This list provides a general framework for implementing data integrity checks at each stage of your ETL process.
