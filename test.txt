   - **Relationships**: Linked to the `transactions` table via `transaction_id`.

## Data Quality Checks
Mechanisms and rules to verify data quality. Mention any automated or manual validations, such as duplication checks, null value checks, or quality thresholds.

**Example**:
- Ensures no duplicate `transaction_id` entries.
- Validates that `amount` is a positive value.
- Checks that the `payment_method` field only contains valid entries like 'Credit Card', 'PayPal', or 'Bank Transfer'.

- **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel have access to customer transaction data. This is enforced through role-based permissions.
- **Anonymization**: All customer data is anonymized before being used for analytics.

## Troubleshooting
Tips for troubleshooting common issues associated with this data category, such as errors in extraction, loading, or processing.

**Example**:
- **Issue**: Transaction data missing from the staging table.
  - **Solution**: Check the upstream job logs to ensure the file `transactions.csv` was generated and moved to the correct location.
- **Issue**: Data quality check failed due to invalid payment method.
  - **Solution**: Investigate if new payment methods were introduced without proper validation rules.
