4. **Track Volunteer Retention and Growth**  
   - Examine historical data to identify trends in participation and expand internal volunteer programs.

5. **Automate Updates and Regular Reporting**  
   - Implement a continuous data flow so decision-makers have real-time information to adapt campaigns accordingly.
