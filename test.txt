Performance Dashboard:

A centralized dashboard for real-time monitoring of ETL jobs.
Offers detailed analytics on process performance, allowing users to quickly assess job statuses and identify bottlenecks.
Facilitates proactive management of ETL workflows by providing insights into job execution and efficiency.
Data Lineage (In Development):

This feature is currently under development.
Will offer a graphical representation of data flow from source to target, making it easier to trace data origins and understand the impact of changes.
Aims to enhance visibility into how data transformations affect downstream processes and systems.



Observability
Comprehensive Monitoring:

Provides in-depth tracing of resource usage, data loading operations, status updates, and transformations throughout the ETL pipeline.
Integrated with OpenTelemetry to deliver advanced monitoring capabilities, ensuring full pipeline visibility and enabling swift issue detection and resolution.
Current Implementation:

Non-Prod Environment: Observability features are fully implemented, providing detailed monitoring and diagnostics during development and testing phases.
Production Environment: Implementation for production environments is planned for the near future, ensuring that the same level of observability will be extended to live operations.
