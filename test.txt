The Polling module is responsible for processing files from a Network File System (NFS) and uploading them to Snowflake's internal stages using the PUT command. This module ensures that the files are correctly transferred and ready for subsequent loading into Snowflake tables.

File Transfer Integrity: Verifies that files are transferred completely and without corruption by comparing file sizes before and after transfer.
Line Count Verification: Ensures the number of lines in the file post-transfer matches the original, confirming data integrity.
Error Handling and Retries: Automatically retries failed transfers and logs detailed error information to ensure successful file uploads.
File Splitting Management: Handles large files by splitting them into smaller parts if needed, ensuring all parts are correctly uploaded.
