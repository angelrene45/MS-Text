Right now, the process to access and work with data is slow and inefficient.

First, many business users can’t easily get the data they need because they don’t fully understand the data schema or know SQL.

Second, existing BI dashboards are often outdated, static, and don’t allow for the flexibility users need to explore data freely.

And third, because of this, data teams spend a lot of time answering repetitive, ad hoc questions — time that could be better spent on high-impact analytics.

Cortex Analyst aims to change that."
