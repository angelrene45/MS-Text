Hi [Name],

Thanks for the detailed explanation. Based on the challenges you've outlined around structured content extraction from PDFs for the disclosure surveillance project, we believe Snowflake Cortex could be a great fit.

Cortex allows us to:
- Parse and analyze raw document content using SQL functions.
- Split text into structured chunks with context-preserving overlap using `SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER`.
- Apply large language models (LLMs) directly in Snowflake to detect analyst mentions, company names, and assess whether disclosures are appropriate, underdisclosed, or overdisclosed.

Additionally, tomorrow there will be a hands-on lab where the Snowflake team will demonstrate **Cortex Agents**, **Cortex Search**, and **Document AI**. The session will cover how to process both **PDFs and images**, including extracting structured data such as **tables and section headers**.

As part of that, the function `PARSE_DOCUMENT` will be highlighted. It supports two modes:
- **LAYOUT**: returns structured markdown content, including tables and document layout.
- **OCR** *(default)*: extracts plain text content from scanned or image-based documents.

This functionality aligns closely with our use case, where accurate and structured extraction from "Important Regulatory Disclosures" sections is key.

We can build a pipeline that:
1. Extracts content using `PARSE_DOCUMENT` in the appropriate mode.
2. Splits the content using `SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER`, preserving context.
3. Leverages Cortex LLMs to assess disclosure accuracy for each indexed analyst.
4. Outputs structured flags and summaries for review.

Let me know if you'd like us to prototype this approach on a sample PDF and we can also join the hands-on lab together to explore these features further.

Best regards,
