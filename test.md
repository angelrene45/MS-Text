Sure! Here's your **5‚Äì6 minute English script and slide structure** to present **Snowflake Cortex Analyst (Text-to-SQL)** using **Semantic Views** and **Cortex Search**.

---

## üé§ 1. Introduction (30s)

"Hi everyone, in this presentation I‚Äôll introduce **Snowflake Cortex Analyst**, a fully-managed, LLM-powered service that allows users to ask business questions in natural language and get accurate SQL responses."

"I‚Äôll explain how **semantic views** provide business context to the models, how text-to-SQL is generated, and how it can be enhanced with **Cortex Search** for unstructured data."

---

## 2. High-Level Overview (1 min)

* **What is Cortex Analyst?**
  It‚Äôs a **fully managed REST API** that uses large language models to translate business questions into SQL against structured data in Snowflake.

* **Which LLMs are used?**
  It leverages multiple models like Meta Llama, Mistral, OpenAI, and others depending on your configuration (including private models).

* **Architecture**:
  Cortex Analyst is built as a **multi-agent system** that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. It‚Äôs part of **Snowflake Cortex AI**, alongside tools like Cortex Search, Document AI, and Copilot.

## 3. Semantic Layer: Semantic View vs Semantic Model (1.5 min)

"To make text-to-SQL accurate, Cortex Analyst needs **business context**. That‚Äôs where **semantic views** or **semantic models** come in."

* **What are they?**
  These define how business concepts like KPIs, metrics, filters, and synonyms map to your actual database tables, views, or dynamic tables.

* **Semantic Model vs Semantic View**:

  * Both use the **same YAML syntax**.
  * A **semantic model** is a YAML file stored in a stage. It‚Äôs file-based, more dev-oriented.
  * A **semantic view** is a **native Snowflake object**‚Äîcreated using SQL or Snowsight‚Äîwhich supports RBAC, CI/CD pipelines, sharing, and governance.

* **Recommendation**:
  Prefer **semantic views** for long-term use‚Äîthey‚Äôre more flexible and easier to manage in production.

* **How to create?**

  * You can create them using the **Snowsight UI**, which provides a step-by-step wizard.
  * Or use SQL directly with `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW`.

## 4. How Text-to-SQL Works (1 min)

"Once the semantic layer is defined, Cortex Analyst uses that to generate accurate SQL."

* **Example**:
  If you ask ‚ÄúWhat is the net revenue in Q2?‚Äù, Cortex Analyst maps **'net revenue'** to a metric in your semantic view, understands time filtering, and generates SQL accordingly.

* **Why it's accurate**:

  * The semantic view adds domain context.
  * It can include **verified queries**, synonyms, and fallback logic.
  * It uses **literal retrieval** for values like ‚ÄúNorth America‚Äù ‚Üí which may map to multiple country codes.

## 5. Cortex Search ‚Äì for RAG & Documents (1 min)

"For working with documents or unstructured data, we can use **Cortex Search**."

* It indexes documents by breaking them into **chunks**, then creates **embeddings**.
* When a user asks a question, Cortex Search:

  1. Retrieves the most relevant chunks using semantic similarity.
  2. Sends that context to the LLM for **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
  3. Returns a relevant and grounded answer.

**Use Case**: You can combine Cortex Search + Analyst in an application: structured data goes through Analyst; documents go through Search.

---

## 6. Demo Flow Example (1 min)

Here's a simplified demo flow:

1. Create a **semantic view** in Snowsight: define metrics, dimensions, filters, and synonyms.
2. Call the **Cortex Analyst REST API**:

   * Send a natural language question.
   * Receive a response with the generated `sql_query` and the `results`.
3. Run the SQL in Snowflake and display the output.
4. Optional: Integrate **Cortex Search** to enrich queries with context from PDFs or documents.

---

## 7. Final Thoughts & Summary (30s)

**Benefits**:

* Enables natural language access to data.
* High precision (90%+ in internal benchmarks).
* Works well with governed, production-ready Snowflake environments via semantic views.

**Limitations**:

* Requires effort to define the semantic layer properly.
* As of now, join logic is still limited depending on release version.

**Takeaway**:
Cortex Analyst is great for PoCs and production use cases‚Äîespecially when paired with semantic views and Cortex Search for hybrid structured/unstructured scenarios.

### ‚úÖ Tips for your slides:

* Use diagrams:

  * Cortex Analyst architecture (semantic layer + LLM + SQL).
  * Comparison table: Semantic View vs Semantic Model.
  * Sample question ‚Üí SQL transformation.
* Include screenshots of Snowsight (semantic view wizard, query preview).
* If possible, show a live or recorded demo.
