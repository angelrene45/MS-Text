## ✅ Context Summary

> “I’m building an interactive application (using Streamlit) that uses Cortex Analyst through a class instrumented with `TruLens`. My goal is to send traces to **Snowflake Cortex AI Observability**, but I also need to **capture and return the output (`response`) immediately** to display to the user. I understand that `TruApp.run()` is used for evaluations, but it doesn’t return the output, and `RunConfig` is designed for batch testing only.”

## 🔧 Questions for Snowflake Engineering

### 🔍 Regarding real-time trace capture

1. **Is there a way to send individual traces from an instrumented function (`@instrument`) in real-time to Cortex AI Observability, without triggering a full `TruApp.run()` evaluation?**

2. **Are there any plans to support trace logging from interactive applications (like frontend UIs or APIs) to Cortex Observability, outside of formal evaluation runs?**

3. **What is the recommended approach to connect a single instrumented method (e.g., `answer_query()`) with Cortex Observability in a way that supports real-time trace recording without committing to a full evaluation run?**

---

### ⚙️ On TruApp usage and output access

4. **Is there any way to retrieve the actual output (`response`) from an evaluation triggered via `TruApp.run()` in Python, or is the output exclusively stored in Snowflake for offline analysis?**

5. **Can we tag a trace or run with external metadata such as a `session_id`, `user_id`, or `trace_id` to later identify the matching record from Snowflake via SQL or Observability UI?**

---

### 📡 Regarding backend or API trace ingestion

6. **Is there an official API or telemetry endpoint to send traces or spans directly to Cortex Observability from backend services, bypassing `TruApp.run()`?**

7. **What is the recommended architecture for backend or API-based LLM applications that need to both return the result immediately and persist the trace for auditability in Snowflake Cortex Observability?**

---

### 💡 Open-ended design feedback

8. **What are the current best practices for interactive GenAI applications that need both real-time results (to return to users) and complete trace observability (for monitoring and governance)?**
