### Automatic Semantic Model Generation  
**In just three steps**

1️⃣ **Connect Your Context**  
Bring in dashboards, worksheets, Tableau data sources, or query history — whatever defines your business logic.  

2️⃣ **Review Smart Suggestions**  
Get a draft semantic model with AI-generated YAML that includes metrics, joins, and filters.  

3️⃣ **Click “Optimize”**  
Use a powerful agentic AI refinement tool to further boost Cortex Analyst accuracy without lifting a finger.





### Semantic Models, Without the Manual Work  
Tap into all your existing data artifacts — no need to start from scratch.

**Integrations:**
- Tableau  
- Snowflake  
- AtScale  
- Sigma  
- LookML *(Coming soon)*  
- Power BI *(Coming soon)*  
- PDF *(Coming soon)*





🎯 Slide 1 – Automatic Semantic Model Generation
🗣️ Script (about 45 seconds)

On this slide, we can see how Snowflake is simplifying the creation of semantic models using AI.

The process happens in just three simple steps:
First, we connect our context — meaning our dashboards, worksheets, data sources, or even query history — anything that defines our business logic.

Then, AI automatically generates smart suggestions in YAML format, including metrics, joins, and filters.

Finally, with just one click on “Optimize,” the system uses an intelligent refinement layer to further boost the accuracy of the Cortex Analyst — without any manual effort.

In short, what used to take hours or days can now be done in just minutes, powered by automation and AI.

💡 Slide 2 – Semantic Models, Without the Manual Work
🗣️ Script (about 30–40 seconds)

On this slide, Snowflake emphasizes that there’s no need to start from scratch when building semantic models.

The platform can tap into your existing data artifacts, integrating seamlessly with tools like Tableau, Snowflake, AtScale, and Sigma.

Coming soon, it will also support LookML, Power BI, and PDF exports.

This approach removes the need for repetitive manual setup and allows organizations to adopt semantic modeling much faster and more efficiently.
