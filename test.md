3. **Which employees have no recorded interactions?**
4. **Which employees have participated in priority client interactions (`IS_PRIORITY_CONTACT = 'Y'`)?**

---

### ✅ 2. Validate Usage of `RMS_DIM_EMPLOYEE` Columns

1. **What is the research area of the employees with the highest number of interactions?** (`RESEARCH_AREA`)
2. **What officer titles are held by the employees with the most interactions?** (`OFFICER_LEVEL_TITLE_HIST`)
3. **Which primary business units are involved in the most interactions?** (`PRIMARY_BUSINESS_UNIT_HIST`)
4. **How many interactions were led by producer employees?** (`PRODUCER_EMP_FLAG`)

### ✅ 4. Validate Synonyms and Natural Language Descriptions

1. **Which employees had face-to-face meetings?** → `PHYSICAL_TYPE = 'In-person'`
2. **Who participated in virtual meetings with priority clients?** → `PHYSICAL_TYPE = 'Virtual'`, `IS_PRIORITY_CONTACT = 'Y'`
3. **Show me the analysts with the most live sessions.** → `LIVE_TYPE = 'Live'`
4. **How many research producers had calls this year?**
