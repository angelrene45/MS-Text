# ‚úÖ Best Practices: Building a Semantic Model with Snowflake Cortex Analyst

## üìå Context
Over the past few months, our engineering and analyst teams have been exploring the **Snowflake Cortex Analyst** and its capabilities to enable **Text-to-SQL** for self-service analytics. As part of this initiative, we implemented a **POC (Proof of Concept)** using real data from various domains such as CRM, Research Reports, and vendor platforms like Visible Alpha.

## üß† Cortex Analyst Semantic Model Calibration

> _The heart of any Text-to-SQL system is a calibrated and aligned semantic model._

The process of calibrating the semantic model involves a **cyclical, iterative workflow**, ensuring alignment between the data schema, domain-specific language, and validated SQL queries. Below is the calibration loop we followed:

### Calibration Loop:
1. **Semantic Model Description**: Define key entities, metrics, and relationships in business terms.
2. **DB Schema Mapping**: Align semantic descriptions with physical Snowflake schema (tables, views).
3. **Cortex Search Integration**: Enable literal search over metadata to improve grounding.
4. **Custom Instructions**: Tailor the analyst behavior to handle domain-specific vocabulary and intent.
5. **Verified Queries**: Validate generated SQL outputs with SMEs and QA feedback.
6. **Re-calibrate**: Update semantic models based on verified feedback and improve the loop.

### ‚úîÔ∏è What Worked Well:
- Easy prototyping of semantic models using Cortex Analyst tools.
- Good coverage across CRM and vendor datasets (Visible Alpha, LinkUp, etc.).
- Literal grounding using **Cortex Search** improved the relevance of model responses.
- Flexible architecture to maintain **multiple semantic models** per data domain.
- Integration with **Trulens** provided visibility and observability into model responses.

## üí° Best Practices for Semantic Model Development

1. **Start Small, Iterate Quickly**  
   Begin with a single data domain and iterate through the calibration loop rapidly.

2. **Partner with Domain SMEs**  
   Collaborate closely with subject matter experts to ensure accurate model language.

3. **Schema Simplification**  
   Create simplified views or logical models that abstract complexity for the analyst.

4. **Test with Real User Questions**  
   Use production-style queries and questions during calibration, not just synthetic ones.

5. **Validate with SQL Experts**  
   Every generated SQL should be reviewed and validated for accuracy and performance.

6. **Document Assumptions**  
   Keep clear documentation of metric definitions, table mappings, and vocabulary.

7. **Monitor via Trulens or Custom Logs**  
   Observability helps you fine-tune the model and detect drifts or misalignments.

## üöÄ Next Steps
We are continuing to onboard new datasets and refine our instructions using learnings from this POC. Our goal is to empower users with reliable, explainable self-service analytics powered by natural language and Snowflake.
