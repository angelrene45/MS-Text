Hi [Name],

Thanks for the detailed explanation. Based on the challenges you've outlined around structured content extraction from PDFs for the disclosure surveillance project, we believe Snowflake Cortex could be a suitable solution.

Cortex allows us to:
- Parse and analyze raw PDF text using SQL functions.
- Split text into structured chunks with context-preserving overlap using `SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER`.
- Apply large language models (LLMs) directly inside Snowflake to detect analyst mentions, holding positions, and evaluate if the disclosures are appropriate, underdisclosed, or overdisclosed.

We can build a pipeline that:
1. Extracts raw text from each PDF.
2. Splits the content into manageable sections with overlap to maintain context.
3. Uses Snowflakeâ€™s built-in LLM capabilities to review each section for analyst disclosures based on defined rules.
4. Returns structured results highlighting discrepancies or compliance.

Let me know if you'd like us to prototype this approach using a sample set of PDFs to validate feasibility.

Best regards,
