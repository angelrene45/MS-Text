Summary of Best Practices:
Clearly define fact tables – Include primary keys, natural IDs, data attributes, joins, and synonyms.

Clearly define dimension tables – Include keys, attributes, joins with fact tables, bridge table roles, and synonyms.

Detail dimension-to-fact table joins via bridge tables – Specify keys, attributes, and synonym usage.

Verify joins between tables – Start with two tables and test if joins are one-to-one or many-to-one.

Describe columns explicitly – Mention if they are primary or natural keys and avoid synonyms if data cardinality is low.
